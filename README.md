# Raytracing

This is the final project of the Computer Graphics discipline at UFRN.

It consists of a implementation of the Ray Tracing algorithm in WebGL. To see our demo: TODO.demo

### Contributing

### Future plans

Upon successful implementation in WebGL, we plan on implementing the algorithm in C++ and porting to run on the browser using WebAssembly.
